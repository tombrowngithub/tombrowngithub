Hey there, I’m Tom
Full-Stack Software Developer | React/ReactNative Mentor | YouTube Educator

I build scalable mobile/web apps with the MERN stack and React Native, and teach thousands of developers on YouTube. With 5+ years of experience, I specialize in:

Cross-platform apps (iOS & Android)

AI-powered automation (OpenAI, Groq)

Localized gig economies (like my current project, Neowork)

Mentorship through hands-on tutorials and tech breakdowns

What I Do
Develop: React Native & React.js apps (performance-optimized, secure)

Teach: Share my expertise via YouTube (React Native, React.js, tech deep-dives)

Build Backends: Scalable APIs with Node.js, Firebase, Supabase, MongoDB

Solve Real Problems: Focus on apps that empower users (e.g., healthcare, gig work)


 Featured Projects
🔥 Neowork (React Native • Firebase • Geolocation)
Localizing the gig economy for underserved communities

Problem Solved: Formal job platforms like Upwork exclude non-technical/local work (e.g., "Fix my roof," "Install solar panels").

Innovation:
Hirer/Tasker Model: Simplified job posting → proposal → payment flow with escrow-like security.
Hyperlocal Focus: GPS-based task matching for domestic/technical jobs.
Tech: Real-time Firebase updates, Stripe/Paystack integration, offline-first design.

💌 Cudship (React Native • Firebase • Algorithms)
Dating app designed for scale

Key Tech:
1M+ User Ready: Optimized Firestore queries, CDN caching for media.
Live Proximity Matching: Background geolocation updates + privacy safeguards.
Anti-Spam AI: Custom algorithm to detect fake profiles (OpenAI moderation).
Status: Beta testing with 500 users.

🏥 EthiopeAZHealth (React Native • WebSockets • Subscriptions)
Telemedicine for emerging markets

Impact:
VIP Chat Monetization: $4/month subscription boosts doctor earnings.
Critical Feature: Offline-capable appointment reminders (SMS fallback).
Stats: 50+ doctors onboarded pre-launch.

💳 Buzzy.ng (Play Store | Apple Store)
Fintech super-app

My Contributions:
Biometric Auth: Reduced fraud by 65% via fingerprint/PIN layers.
Video Ad Engine: Built with FFmpeg, increased ad revenue by 40%.
